"Iâ€™m a multidisciplinary designer, artist and educator with a diverse set of toolkits, skills and frameworks to contribute to the IDEO CoLab Makeathon. Through my work in designing interactive experiences, objects and installations, I have cultivated a toolkit of design methodologies that allow me to ask the right questions, identify solutions and build different kinds of prototypes. I am experienced with design research, human centered co-design processes (including community interviews and workshops), rapid prototyping in everything from cardboard to circuits, and systems thinking. I have a varied set of skills, from the visual (graphic design, video, projection) to the physical (fabrication, physical prototyping, DIY hardware) to the technical (front-end software development, creative coding).
